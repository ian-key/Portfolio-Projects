##### Details
Here are some user stories that you need to achieve for this project.
1. I can access all the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
2. I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
3. I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) as stylish placeholders.)
4. I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
5. A link to [https://www.altcademy.com](https://www.altcademy.com) on your website, makes most sense to put it at the footer. The text can be something like "Part of Altcademy's Fullstack Program".
